# Sink

The `Sink` objects control the data ingestion to a destination system, like a file store or database.

Any class that implements the `Sink` interface must implement the method `consume()`, necessary for the data ingestion. This method must use the metadata generated by the `Source` class to write the data to the correct location. For example, a sink that writes to S3 must do something like the following:

```python
def consume(self, generator):
    for data in generator:
        file_to_write = "raw/%/%/date=%s" % (
            data["source_api"], data["source_data"], data["produce_date"]
        )
        s3_client.write(data["data"], file_to_write)
```

Assuming that the `s3_client.write()` method needs a list of dictionaries and the file name to write to S3, this code executes what is necessary to write to the right location using the embedded metadata.
